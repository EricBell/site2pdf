Test geckodriver download:
  python -c "from webdriver_manager.firefox import GeckoDriverManager; print(GeckoDriverManager().install())"

  What This Enables

  With Firefox installed, the authentication system will:
  1. ✅ Try Firefox first (more stable in WSL)
  2. ❌ Fall back to Chrome if Firefox fails
  3. 🧑‍💻 Fall back to manual intervention if both fail

  Firefox generally works much better than Chrome in WSL environments, so this should resolve the "unable to connect to renderer" errors
  you've been experiencing.
